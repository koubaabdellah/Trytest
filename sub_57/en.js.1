General information</title><paragraph> Before you buy a ticket using the assisted booking service, Aviasales recommends that you carefully read these terms and conditions.</paragraph><paragraph> Assisted booking service by Aviasales is a technical solution with some of our partners (agencies and airlines), allowing the passenger to fill out a booking form with their data in a simplified manner without going to the partner’s website to do this. At the same time, a ticket is issued and payment is accepted by the partner directly.</paragraph><title>2. Booking Form</title><paragraph> By clicking the "Pay" button you confirm the accuracy of all entered personal data (name, date of birth, citizenship and passport data, email address, and contact phone number). Neither Aviasales nor the partner is responsible for the personal and contact information you may have entered incorrectly.</paragraph><paragraph> Your full name, date of birth, citizenship, and passport data must be entered on the booking form exactly as written in your civil passport or international passport if this document will be presented at check-in.</paragraph><title>3. Fare rules</title><paragraph> Aviasales will offer you to familiarize yourself with the detailed description of the fare in the "Fare rules" section under the booking form. At the same time, the conditions for any changes in the electronic tickets issued for the trip, including return and exchange are regulated by the internal rules of airlines and may impose fines on the ticket buyer.</paragraph><paragraph> Aviasales will offer you to familiarize yourself with the baggage rules of airlines participating in the carriage of passengers on selected flights before buying a ticket, in the “Fare rules” section under the booking form. You must familiarize yourself with the check-in rules for the flight and the fares established by the carrier for excess baggage, check-in, and other possible fees applicable to the selected flights. Such rules can be found on the airline’s website or by contacting the airline in any way available.</paragraph><title>4. Visas and Baggage</title><paragraph> Before you travel Aviasales strongly warns you to independently find out all issues related to the visa policy of the countries of visit and transit for your country of citizenship. Also, if you are traveling with baggage, check the rules for baggage handling at the transit point yourself. Answers to these questions can be obtained round-the-clock from Aviasales support team at help@aviasales.ru.</paragraph><title>5. Payment</title><paragraph> In some cases, tickets are issued within 24 hours of payment. If you didn’t receive the itinerary receipt after payment, and you made sure that money was debited from your account and at least 24 hours have passed, you must contact Aviasales support team at help@aviasales.ru.</paragraph><paragraph> If an error occurred during payment/ticket issuing, you should contact the support team immediately and not make new attempts to buy a ticket until information on the causes of the error and instructions for further actions are received from the support team.</paragraph>',agreementTitle:"Terms of use",buyFor:"Book for <0/>",buyForApplePay:"Buy with",cardDescription:"The payment is processed directly by {{label}}.
