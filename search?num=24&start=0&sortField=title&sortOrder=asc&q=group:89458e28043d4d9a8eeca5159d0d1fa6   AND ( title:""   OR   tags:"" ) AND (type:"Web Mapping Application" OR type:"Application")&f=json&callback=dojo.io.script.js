The data includes currently geo-coded dwellings that have had a BER done. After clicking on a Small Area the map generates basic summary statistics including a break-down by dwelling type, BER rating, BER value, heating fuel, controls, etc. The map includes a filter that allows users to filter by the percentage of BERs done in a Small Area (to operate the filter simply type in the desired percentage). The map also allows user to select Small Areas with a desired combination of median BERs. <\/div><div><br /><\/div><div><b><u>BER Map background:<\/u><\/b><\/div><div>This tool, created in ArcGIS software, allows user to gather various information about dwelling clusters within Ireland. The information it provides is based on the data captured by the DEAP calculator during BER assessment. Some of the examples of the tool\u2019s usefulness are as follows. It can identify clusters of homes with poor BER (suggestive of poor levels of insulation and or poor heating system) allowing for more accurate targeting of marketing and support services. It can also be used to understand heating demand, electrical demand etc. in a given area which may be useful for planning purposes. For example, the map can identify areas where district heating projects may be efficient.<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>The clusters used by the tool correspond to Small Areas as given by Central Statistical Office. The information provided for each Small Area has been calculated from total number of dwellings within a given Small Area that had their BER done and their address was successfully geo-located. All the information provided by the current BER Map represents 33% of the total Irish residential dwelling stock. <\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>An analysis conducted on random sample of successfully geo-located dwellings revealed that 2% of geo-located dwellings had incorrect Small Area associated with them. Any error rate of less than 5% would have statistically non-significant effect on the overall information provided by the BER Map. Hence, the error rate of 2% means that information provided by this tool is very accurate. However, a potential drawback is that the map only represents 33% of total Irish residential dwelling stock resulting in information provided for some Small Areas is based on relatively small proportion of dwellings.<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div><b><u>How to use the BER Map:<\/u><\/b><\/div><div>The BER Map shows colour coded Small Areas. Colours represent a BER rating of a median (an average) dwelling. Those medians were derived from all geo-located dwellings with BER in the particular Small Area. Hence, the Small areas that contain mostly dwellings with good BERs are represented by green colours while Small Areas containing mostly dwellings with poor BERs are represented by red and purple colours. If a Small Area has no colour, it means that no information is available for the particular Small Area.<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>To retrieve the information about a particular Small Area simply click on any coloured Small Area and a popup window will appear. The information provided contains a breakdown by dwelling type (detached, semi-detached, mid-terraced, end-terraced, ground-floor-apt, mid-floor-apt, top-floor-apt), BER rating (A1 to G), heating controls (poor, good, ideal), space heating fuel (biomass, community heating, electricity, oil, gas, LPG, solid fuel). The information provided also contains total number of dwellings, total number of dwellings with BER, mean BER, median BER, etc.<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>To exclude Small Areas where the information provided is based on small proportion of dwellings, please use a &quot;Percentage of BERs done per Small Area filter&quot;. By simply typing in a minimum percentage of BERs done the map is recalculated and only Small Areas that contain the larger percentage of BERs done than the one provided are displayed.<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>A user can also enable or disable drawing of Small Areas with a specific colour (median BER). To do so, simply select the desired combination of median BERs to be displayd in the &quot;Select BER&quot; section.<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>To search for a specific address location, use the search button located in the top left corner of the map section.<\/div><\/div>","tags":["BER","Small Area"],"snippet":"A colour coded BER map of Ireland per Small Area.
